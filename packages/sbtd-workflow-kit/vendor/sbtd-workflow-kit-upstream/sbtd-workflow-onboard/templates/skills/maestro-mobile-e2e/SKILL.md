# Maestro Mobile E2E

Use this Skill for Mobile / Hybrid E2E work that uses Maestro.

This Skill does not replace `gherkin-bdd`, `project-validation`, Trellis, project tests, or human review. BDD `.feature` files are the behavior source of truth; Maestro flow YAML files are executable Mobile / Hybrid E2E assets derived from selected BDD scenarios.

## Workflow

1. Confirm the task involves Android, iOS, React Native, Flutter, Hybrid App, mobile smoke, or cross-device user journeys.
2. Read the relevant BDD `.feature` scenarios first. If no BDD scenario exists for user-visible behavior, return to `gherkin-bdd` before generating flow assets.
3. Run the mobile context gate before generating or running flows.
4. Decide whether the BDD scenario should become a Maestro flow. Use Maestro for device-level journeys, native permissions, deep links, system UI, mobile navigation, or Hybrid flows that cannot be covered reliably by Web E2E alone.
5. Classify the run mode: `full-stack`, `contract-backed`, `app-mocked`, `smoke-only`, or `blocked`.
6. Generate or update flow assets under `maestro/flow/`.
7. Before running Maestro, confirm Java 17+, Maestro CLI, target device / simulator, app binary or installed app, bundle id / app id, test account, and environment.
8. Before any Maestro command that must generate a report, decide whether to use `rtk`. Formal report-producing runs default to native `maestro test` unless the project proves `rtk` is no-cache / report-safe for that command.
9. Run the smallest relevant flow first. Expand to platform smoke or full regression only after the targeted flow is stable.
10. If an iOS real-device failure matches the known issue index, load the matching reference and apply only the relevant fix before rerunning the smallest failing flow.
11. After failures are fixed and targeted reruns pass, run the planned final full validation and generate one final passing report plus one Markdown run summary.
12. Report flow asset paths, commands, `rtk` decision, report files, artifacts location, blocked items, and remaining risk.
13. For Cloud runs, wait for `get_cloud_run_status` to reach a terminal state before retrieving a specific per-flow run's diagnostic status or artifacts.

## Mobile Context Gate

Before writing or running a flow, confirm:

- Platform scope: `ios`, `android`, `both`, or `hybrid`.
- App artifact: `.app`, `.ipa`, `.apk`, installed app, simulator / emulator build, or cloud build.
- App identity: iOS bundle id and / or Android application id.
- Target: iOS Simulator, iOS real device, Android Emulator, Android real device, or cloud device.
- Backend dependency: live environment, mock environment, contract-only backend, or missing backend.
- App launch control: base URL override, launch arguments, deep link, feature flags, clear-state strategy, and deterministic starting screen.
- Data and accounts: test account, role, seed data, cleanup strategy, and environment isolation.
- Selectors: stable accessibility identifiers, stable labels, platform differences, and WebView boundary strategy when applicable.
- System capabilities: permissions, camera, photos, location, notifications, file picker, external app hops, OS dialogs, and native login.

If required context is missing, do not generate a fragile flow. Report `Maestro Flow Assets: blocked` and list the missing facts. Mock-backed or app-mocked flows are allowed only when behavior comes from a contract, real sample, existing fixture, launch argument, or explicit user confirmation; they must not be reported as full-stack E2E.

## Flow Asset Contract

- Store repo-resident Maestro flows in `maestro/flow/`.
- Use `.yml` extension.
- Use English names for both file names and Maestro `name` fields.
- Use lower-kebab-case file names for business scenarios, for example `maestro/flow/login-success.yml`.
- Use `maestro/flow/smoke.yml` for the full regression / smoke flow only.
- When iOS and Android need materially different flows, use platform subdirectories such as `maestro/flow/ios/login-success.yml` and `maestro/flow/android/login-success.yml`; platform smoke flows may use `maestro/flow/ios/smoke.yml` and `maestro/flow/android/smoke.yml`.
- Keep one maintainable flow per business scenario unless the project already has a stronger Maestro architecture.
- Add a short trace comment near the top of generated flows that points back to the source BDD feature path, scenario name, platform scope, and run mode.
- Do not generate fragile flows when stable selectors, deterministic data, app launch state, permissions, or test accounts are unavailable. Report `Maestro Flow Assets: blocked` with the missing prerequisite.

Example flow header:

```yaml
appId: com.example.app
name: Login Success
tags:
  - mobile
  - smoke
---
# BDD: features/authentication/login.feature :: Scenario: 已注册用户使用正确密码登录
# Platform: ios
# Mode: full-stack
- launchApp
- tapOn: "Email"
- inputText: "${MAESTRO_TEST_EMAIL}"
- tapOn: "Password"
- inputText: "${MAESTRO_TEST_PASSWORD}"
- tapOn: "Login"
- assertVisible: "Home"
```

## BDD To Flow Mapping

- Map `Given` to deterministic app state, fixtures, launch arguments, deep links, or setup steps.
- Map `When` to user actions such as `tapOn`, `inputText`, `scrollUntilVisible`, `back`, `swipe`, or nested subflows.
- Map `Then` to visible, accessible, persisted, or emitted outcomes such as `assertVisible`, `assertNotVisible`, or stable post-action screen state.
- Prefer accessibility identifiers and stable user-visible labels. If the app lacks stable selectors for critical controls, propose the minimal selector addition and stop unless the user has approved product code changes.
- Keep secrets out of flow files. Use environment variables or project-approved test secret injection.
- Use nested flows only when they remove real duplication and remain readable.

## Report Contract

When a planned Maestro validation run executes, it must request a native report with `--format` / `--output` or the project's equivalent reporter unless prerequisites are blocked before the runner can start. Write a named native report under `.maestro/reports/` in the project root, plus one Markdown run summary with the same stem, branch slug, and timestamp. Do this even when the flow fails or the final full rerun is blocked by environment.

Because Maestro report generation depends on file side effects, formal Mobile / Hybrid E2E runs must not blindly use `rtk`. Prefer native `maestro test` for any run that writes `.xml`, `.html`, trace, artifact, or Markdown evidence. If `rtk` was used for a Maestro command, verify that the expected report file exists, its mtime / size changed during this run, and the contents match the flow that just executed. If the file is missing, stale, empty, mismatched, or `rtk` output suggests cache hit / replay / skipped write, rerun the same scope with native `maestro test` and treat the native result as authoritative.

Debugging and targeted reruns may use stdout only, but stdout-only runs never satisfy the final formal report gate. If a debugging or targeted rerun does produce a native report, preserve it as a timestamped report snapshot before running another Maestro command that might overwrite or clean the same output. Multiple local report snapshots are allowed across rounds; the final result is still the last planned full rerun status. If the last useful run was stdout-only and Mobile / Hybrid E2E remains in formal validation scope, rerun the planned scope with a native reporter or mark `Final Test Report` and `Run Summary MD` as blocked.

Use this timestamp shape in local time:

```text
YYYY_mm_dd-HH_MM_SS
```

Use `branch_slug` for the current branch segment in report file names. Prefer the current git branch or the project / CI branch ref; use `detached-{short_sha}` for detached HEAD and `unknown-branch` when no git context exists. Preserve only letters, digits, `.`, `_`, and `-`; replace `/`, spaces, and other special characters with `_`. Record the raw branch and `branch_slug` in the Markdown summary.

Report file names:

```text
.maestro/reports/maestro-report-{flow_name}-{branch_slug}-{YYYY_mm_dd}-{HH_MM_SS}.xml
.maestro/reports/maestro-report-{flow_name}-{branch_slug}-{YYYY_mm_dd}-{HH_MM_SS}.html
.maestro/reports/maestro-report-{flow_name}-{branch_slug}-{YYYY_mm_dd}-{HH_MM_SS}.md
```

`flow_name` is the flow file stem, such as `login-success` or `smoke`. Keep `flow_name` in the report file name even when the flow is derived from a BDD `.feature`; the Markdown summary records the source `.feature` path and scenario name.

Example commands:

```bash
mkdir -p .maestro/reports
flow=maestro/flow/login-success.yml
flow_name=$(basename "$flow" .yml)
raw_branch=${GITHUB_HEAD_REF:-${GITHUB_REF_NAME:-}}
if [ -z "$raw_branch" ]; then
  raw_branch=$(git branch --show-current 2>/dev/null || true)
fi
if [ -z "$raw_branch" ]; then
  short_sha=$(git rev-parse --short HEAD 2>/dev/null || true)
  if [ -n "$short_sha" ]; then
    raw_branch="detached-${short_sha}"
  else
    raw_branch="unknown-branch"
  fi
fi
branch_slug=$(printf "%s" "$raw_branch" | LC_ALL=C tr -cs 'A-Za-z0-9._-' '_' | sed 's/^_*//; s/_*$//')
branch_slug=${branch_slug:-unknown-branch}
stamp=$(date +%Y_%m_%d-%H_%M_%S)
maestro test --format junit --output ".maestro/reports/maestro-report-${flow_name}-${branch_slug}-${stamp}.xml" "$flow"
```

Use the project-required native reporter. Default to JUnit when CI needs machine-readable output; use HTML only when the project or user asks for human-readable local reports. Prefer writing directly to the branch-and-timestamped report file. If a project wrapper can only emit into a fixed or runner-managed output directory, use `.maestro/reports/.maestro-current/` as the temporary output and copy or rename the result to `maestro-report-{flow_name}-{branch_slug}-{timestamp}` before the next Maestro run. Do not treat `~/.maestro/tests`, `.maestro-current/`, or a fixed `report.xml` / `report.html` path as the formal preserved report.

If project configuration forces multiple reporters, treat them as one report set from the same run, and still generate only one Markdown summary for that report set. If Maestro CLI never produces a native report because prerequisites are blocked, the runner crashes before reporting, or the only executed command was stdout-only, mark the report and summary as blocked instead of claiming generation.

The Markdown summary must be written in Chinese. Status enum values, commands, file paths, case / flow names, raw error messages, and technical identifiers may remain in English. The summary must include platform scope, run mode, mock strategy, raw branch, `branch_slug`, executed case / flow list, source `.feature` path and scenario name for each flow, final report path, total rounds, each round command, failed case / flow, failure classification, fix summary, changed files, targeted rerun result, affected subset rerun result, final full rerun result, skipped items, and remaining risk. When the report is intended as PR or knowledge-base evidence, also include evidence source, repository key, raw source ref, full commit SHA, worktree state, source revision, trigger, environment alignment, publication status, and the evidence sidecar / envelope path defined by `project-validation/references/validation-evidence-contract.md`. `branch_slug` is not revision identity. Do not include real accounts, secrets, PII, production data, full tokens, sensitive headers, or production screenshots.

For PR or knowledge-base evidence, generate a same-report-stem `.evidence.json` or reference a cross-tool evidence envelope. Generic report evidence may use the project-validation v1 schema. Scenario-backed execution evidence is valid only as v2: the Maestro JUnit testcase must carry an extractable `sbtd.sourceLocatorDigest` property that equals the recomputed source locator, and the envelope must pass `scripts/validate_validation_evidence.py` from the installed `project-validation` Skill root, not this Maestro Skill directory. If the current Maestro reporter or adapter cannot emit that property, keep the human-readable report and mark v2 scenario execution evidence `blocked`. Do not fabricate a link. A dirty developer worktree remains `local-only`; knowledge-server runs require an exact revision set. Ordinary local Maestro diagnostics do not require an evidence sidecar.

## Cloud Run Diagnostics

For a Cloud upload, retain the `upload_id` and `project_id` returned by `run_on_cloud`, and poll `get_cloud_run_status` until the upload is terminal. When a failing or warned flow provides its per-flow `run_id`, use `describe_cloud_run` to inspect that run's status and diagnostic artifacts.

Read the default individual artifacts first. Request the complete artifact archive only when screenshots or failed-step view hierarchies are necessary, because archive URLs are short-lived. Record artifact links or paths as diagnostic evidence only; the Cloud result and its artifacts do not replace the planned native report, same-stem Chinese run summary, or final rerun status.

## Failure Rerun Loop

On failure:

1. Classify the failure as app code, test code, BDD / spec, mock / contract drift, environment / account / data / device, flaky / timing, or out-of-scope.
2. If the issue is in scope and fixable, apply the smallest fix.
3. Rerun the failed flow first.
4. After the failed flow passes, rerun the affected platform subset, such as the same platform smoke flow or related business flow.
5. Run the planned final full validation attempt, then generate the named native report and Chinese Markdown summary from that final attempted run whenever Maestro produced a native report, even if the flow failed.
6. If fail-fast stopped on the first failure, do not assume later flows passed; continue with unrun flows or rerun the planned final validation.

Maestro runtime artifacts still default outside the repository under `~/.maestro/tests` on macOS / Linux unless the command or project config overrides the output directory. Do not treat `~/.maestro/tests` as a repo asset.

## Known Issue Index

Known issue references are lazily loaded. Do not read reference files preemptively.

Read `references/lessons-index.md` only when a Maestro run, setup, or device inspection fails. Then load the referenced file only if tags, keywords, error messages, platform, or version match the current failure.

Current reference topics include:

- iOS real-device setup and Maestro 2.6.1 driver issues.
